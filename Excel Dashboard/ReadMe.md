# US Economy Data Analytics Dashboard

I developed a comprehensive data analytics dashboard to visualize and analyze critical economic indicators of the US economy. This dashboard provides insights into:

## GDP Analysis
A column bar chart compares GDP per capita and nominal GDP across different years.

## Trend Comparisons
Two line charts track the GDP growth rate, inflation rate, unemployment rate, and government debt, highlighting key economic trends.

## Descriptive Statistics
Statistical analysis of GDP growth rate, inflation, and unemployment provides a deeper understanding of the overall economic health.

## Dynamic Lookup
An XLOOKUP function allows for quick retrieval of the GDP growth rate, inflation rate, and unemployment rate for any specified year. Additionally, the dashboard counts the number of years where these values exceed the average.

This project showcases my data visualization and analysis skills using Excel, providing a clear, data-driven view of the US economy.
