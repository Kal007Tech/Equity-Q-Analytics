ðŸš€ SQL Project: Stock Performance & Financial Health Analysis ðŸ’¼ðŸ“Š
I recently completed a SQL-based project analyzing stock performance and company financial health for 2024. This report provided insights into stock prices, trading volumes, transaction patterns, and key financial metrics. Here are some highlights:

âœ… Stock Price & Volume Analysis:
Calculated average daily closing prices and identified top-performing and most volatile stocks.
Analyzed monthly trading volume trends from 1990-2024.

âœ… Transaction Patterns & Financial Ratios:
Identified frequent transaction types (buy/sell) and calculated Price-to-Volume (P/V) ratios for companies.

âœ… Projections & Growth Analysis:
Used SQL to project stock prices via linear regression for Q1 2024.
Evaluated year-over-year growth rates in stock prices and identified stocks with consistent upward trends.
